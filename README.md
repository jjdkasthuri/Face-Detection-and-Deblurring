# Face Detection and Deblurring

This repository contains the implementation of a pipeline for face detection and image deblurring using advanced machine learning models. Face detection uses RetinaFace, and deblurring is performed using the GAN Prior Embedded Network (GPEN).

## Models Used

- **RetinaFace**: A state-of-the-art face detection model that excels in detecting faces within various environments and conditions.
- **GPEN**: Utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to deblur images, effectively restoring details with high precision.

The models are adapted from the [GPEN repository](https://github.com/yangxy/GPEN).

## Repository Content

- **Face Detection and Deblurring Logic**: Code to extract and process frames with detected faces and apply deblurring techniques.
- **Sample Outputs**: A folder containing before-and-after images showcasing the deblurring results.

## Usage

To use this repository for your face detection and deblurring projects, follow these steps:

1. Visit the Kaggle notebook at [Noise Removal GANs Pipeline](https://www.kaggle.com/code/farneetsingh24/noise-removal-gans-pipeline).
2. Copy the notebook to your own Kaggle account.
3. Adapt and run the code according to your specific requirements.
